# Ultimate Weather Station Code Dump
This is the GitHub repository for the project: https://buildcomics.com/meters/final-weatherstation-quest/ \
You will also find the "instructions"  there!

It contains Arduino code for the uno and the mega, code for the beaglebone controlling the two arduinos, python code to collect bandwidth data and a ton of PHP code to get data and display it and store it.\
The data runs as follows: sensors (online, or hardware) ==> PHP code (processing and storing in database and updating the pwm values files) ==> pwm values are sent to beaglebone ==> Beaglebone sends the PWM values to the arduinos ==> Arduino drives the mosfets that drive the meters.

# Disclaimer #
This is not a real code repository, but more a collection of code for re-use. The code is extremely specific for my use (and possibly a tad messy here and there).
